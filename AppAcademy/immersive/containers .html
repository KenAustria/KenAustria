      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>By some accounts, phat kaphrao was included as part of Prime Minister Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram's
        Thai
        cultural mandates during WWII. Phat kaphrao, as well as pad thai, were one of the promoted dishes in local Thai
        food contests. Phat kaphrao was inspired by stir frying, the cooking process of Chinese people. Some of the
        first
        four survivors of the Tham Luang cave rescue asked for phat kaphrao as their first proper meal after two weeks
        of
        being trapped inside the cave.</p>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl
            until well blended.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2
            to 3 minutes. Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the
            juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes. Add about a tablespoon of
            the
            sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to
            cook
            until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.</p>
