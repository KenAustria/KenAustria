    <li>6 tablespoons raw sugar</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    To Prepare the Beef:
    <li>Preheat oven to broil (High Broil if your oven allows you to differentiate) with the oven rack between 6 to 8
      inches from the heating element. (Alternately, you can heat your gas grill to High or lay a bed of hot coals in
      your
      charcoal grill.)</li>
    <li>Combine beef with all the other patty ingredients in a medium size bowl. Mix well with your hands until the
      ingredients are evenly distributed. Divide the meat into two portions. Pat each portion into a square or rectangle
      that is about
      1/2? thick on a rimmed baking sheet. The patties do not have to be shaped perfectly, but try your best to get them
      evenly thick in order to promote even cooking.</li>
    <li>Broil or grill the beef for about 3 minutes on the first side. Carefully flip to prevent breakage. One spatula
      underneath and one spatula pressed lightly against the top works well for the manoeuver. Return the patty to the
      broiler or grill and cook until cooked through. This took 4 more minutes under my broiler. Remove the pan from the
      oven and cool completely.</li>
    <li>While patties cool, combine all of the sauce ingredients in a large skillet or braising pot.
      When the patties are completely cool, cut into squares that are about 1-inch to 1 1/2-inches in size. Bring the
      sauce
      ingredients to a boil over medium high. Stir well, then add the patties to the sauce. Lower heat to medium low and
      simmer, basting the patties and turning occasionally, until the sauce has been reduced, is thick and syrupy and
      has
      been
      mostly absorbed.</li>
    <li>Serve hot or chilled.</li>
    <br />
    To prepare the Garlic Oyster Mushroom Noodles:
    <li>Place a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium high heat with 2 tablespoons of olive oil in it.</li>
    <li>When the oil is shimmering, add the mushrooms with a couple pinches of salt and stir to coat.</li>
    <li>Cook, stirring frequently, until mushrooms are tender and golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add garlic, raw sugar, the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and gochujang.
    </li>
    <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer, stirring constantly until mixture is smooth and somewhat thickened around the
      mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Add the noodles to the pan and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Remove the pan from the heat and toss in the green onions and sesame seeds. Let cool to room temperature or
      colder before serving.</li>
    <br />
    To Assemble Lettuce Wraps:
    <li>Lay out several large lettuce leaves.</li>
    <li>Arrange about 1/8 cup of noodles on each leaf and top with two or so of the simmered beef patties.</li>
    <li>Garnish with additional sesame seeds and green onions, if desired.</li>
  </ol>
